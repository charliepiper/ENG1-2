## Let Ron Cooke
Let Ron Cooke is a single-player student simulator, where the player controls Ron, and takes him through a week at University. Will he survive? Will he pass his exams? Will he get alcohol poisoning? Who knows!

## How to Play
Movement is achieved using `WASD` or the arrow keys.

You can speed up the character using `CTRL`.

Activities can be interacted with using `E`.

There are a few hidden activities around, can you find them?

## Score

The final score for each playthrough is displayed in the end screen - showing the degree grade you recived alongside a leaderboard showing the top 10 scores.
